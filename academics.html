      <p>The Information Technology and Informatics major is part of the School of Communications and Information at Rutgers University – New Brunswick. This multidisciplinary program integrates technology with social sciences like sociology and psychology, offering a well-rounded education in both technology management and its societal impacts. My minor in Sociology has deepened my understanding of the social influence of technology and how to effectively address the needs of diverse groups—skills that are crucial as I pursue a career in the tech field.</p>
      <p>My focus within the major has been on the technical aspects. I've taken courses such as Information Security, Network Technologies, and Web Design, which have helped me develop proficiency in tools like Python and front-end web development languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), along with network troubleshooting. I plan to apply these skills in both academic and professional settings.</p>
      <p>In my final semester (Fall 2025), I plan to take Fundamentals of Data Curation with Python, Database Technologies (SQL), and IT Project Management to further build on my technical expertise.</p>
      <p>A full list of the courses I’ve completed in this program can be found below.</p>
