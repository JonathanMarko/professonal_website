    <h4>Home Server</h4>
    <p>As part of my home lab, I built a physical server using Proxmox as the hypervisor, running TrueNAS Scale within a virtual machine (VM). TrueNAS Scale is a Network Attached Storage (NAS) operating system designed to allow multiple clients to access a storage pool. I created this NAS to address a problem my family faced with storing important family photos. Although housing TrueNAS within a VM is generally not recommended, I chose this configuration to facilitate further homelabbing on the server. Future projects include setting up an intrusion detection system and exploring the creation of a DNS and DHCP server from scratch.</p>

    <h4>NYT API Project (Python)</h4>
    <p>This project was developed for my Object-Oriented Programming class to explore the use of APIs in Python, focusing on the New York Times Article Search API. The assignment involved posing a question and utilizing the API to gather relevant information. I chose to investigate Donald Trump's claim that the media underreported on Joe Biden during the 2020 election. To assess this, I analyzed the total number of articles produced by the politics news desk concerning both candidates. The analysis revealed that the discrepancy in article counts between Trump and Biden fell within two standard deviations from the mean, indicating a normal distribution and suggesting no significant bias in coverage. </p>

    <h4>Neighborly App</h4>
    <P>This prototype mobile app was created using Figma as part of my Human-Computer Interaction class. The main purpose of this project was to explore the principles of UI/UX design by going through the prototyping and development lifecycle. The app was initially developed as a low-fidelity prototype using Miro before transitioning to a high-fidelity prototype in Figma. Below are links to the prototype and the app template; only the components I created are included.</P>

    <h4>Pantry Finder</h4>  
    <p>Pantry Finder was the name of a purely hypothetical application we designed as part of my Management of Technical Organizations class to explore the use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The premise of the app was to aid in the distribution of allergen-free foods. If this app were built, it would have connected people with allergies to food pantries better suited to help them. As a group, we created use case, activity, deployment, and class diagrams for our application. The image below is of our deployment diagram, which I created.</p>
